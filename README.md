# Open-Neuron-Project
Displaying neural connectivity data using D3.js.

Welcome to the Open Neuron Project, the basic idea is to store connectivity data for known neuronal types in a MySQL database, then display that data graphically using data driven documentation.

A working prototype can be found here https://bl.ocks.org/OMHouston/ada82602ae73c9017cbd6495934faab8, but needs a few tweaks to make it accept and work with data from getdata.php rather than static json files.

I am open to any alternative methods of doing things, for me the priority is simplicity and speed for the end-user.

Also, if you have any questions, please ask, I am not a developer, so have probably missed some things out.
